Once you have access to the course: https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1328599
 if you have time next week, it would be ideal
 if you can watch Panopto lectures from 11/7 and 11/14. In the files section,
 there is a pdf slides file for the lecture on Gaussian Processes and Active Learning221101a.
 And here is the colab link for the lecture
 https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vP_324uKsodzV67KQnNW5wObnLQ4l6od 
to follow along. 
We will also provide you with handouts on step-by-step procedures as well as access to
 the Github page where Logan placed all the files.

To set up computer:
install Anaconda. Will need to run Jupyter notebook file.
pip install rpyc
pip install sv_ttk
pip install Gpy (in .ipynb file)
pip install GPyOpt
pip install paramiko
download Arduino IDE
download Logan's Github files.  https://github.com/logansaar/LEGOLAS-Files/tree/main
8/8/23 Had to update numpy in order to import GPy. Use numpy-1.23.5
