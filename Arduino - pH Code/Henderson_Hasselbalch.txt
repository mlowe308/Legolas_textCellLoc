Logan's SURF talk, slides 12-14

Here are several things to work on besides understanding Gaussian processes better:
1.	On Github > Arduino – pH Code, there is a txt file saying that you should watch a Khan Academy video on the
        Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. You will be working with acetic acid and the video discusses acetic acid.
2.	Also you can look at certain slides in Logan Saar’s SURF talk. The slides talk about the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
3.	My recollection is that Logan writes the HH equation differently from the video. Explain the difference.
4.	Make an Excel table with one column for the ratio of base to acid. Calculate the pH, based on the HH equation.



The next goal is to gain more control in measuring pH when there are several solutions of known pH. Design an experiment with ~5 wells.
 Two wells should be occupied by the standards with pH 4 and pH 7. The other wells should contain different ratios of acid/conj_base.
 For a fixed total volume in a well, calculate the amount of acid and conj base that you can pipet accurately with the current setup.
 Plan what you need to make Legolas do in order to measure pH.

If you’re ready to implement your idea on Legolas, pour out an appropriate amount into a cup (stock solutions are in the box).
 Bear in mind that we will not pour the cup contents back into the bottle because of the risk of contamination. If you pour
 too much into the cup, you will have to make more stock solution sooner – doable but it takes time. When you actually make
 the measurements, if the answers are not what you expect, it could be the pH sensor is defective or your method of measurement
 needs improvement.
